# Design thinking process: Individual reflection

This is a short starter outline aimed at ~500 words. Replace bullets with 1–2 sentence answers.

## Context (2–3 sentences)
- Brief: what problem were we tackling, and what was my role?
- Goal: what did I hope to learn or achieve?

## What I Did (3 bullets)
- Empathize: how I gathered insight (e.g., 3 interviews, 1 observation).
- Define: one-sentence problem framing I ended up using.
- Prototype & Test: what I built and who I tested with (2–3 users).

## Key Insight (1–2 bullets)
- The most important thing I learned and why it mattered.

## Decisions and Rationale (2 bullets)
- Decision I made, because X evidence suggested Y.
- What I intentionally did not pursue, and why.

## Outcome (2 bullets)
- What changed or improved as a result (for user or concept).
- What remains uncertain or risky.

## Personal Learning (2 bullets)
- One skill/mindset I strengthened, with a quick example.
- One thing I will do differently next time (how I’ll know).
